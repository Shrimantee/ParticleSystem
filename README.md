# ParticleSystem
Particle Simulation in P5JS

Particles are emitted from the boundary of a disk and multiple emitters are generated at each n time.
For each emitters, there's an attractor enabling a helix choreography of the particles.

A fun feature:

On playing the music, each particle diameter is modified according to the amplitude of the song at that point.
